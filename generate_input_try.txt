Header must be 'f' for frequency and 'Sn' for PSD. Sky-averaging includes a factor of 3/20 compared to non-sky-averaged.

#time_before_merger --> units of years (before end of merger phase based on 1PN formalism, change to FH formalism, which is in both generate_contour_data.py and FD_waveform.py, if want to analyze based on time before merger frequency at ISCO), so 1.0 or less will be safe until close to merger itself.

#if phases is True, the ringdown can get very complicated depending on mass ratio. Default is to locate the peak and start when peak begins to decline. You can however choose a frequency at which to start the ringdown for higher mass ratios (comment out if not) This is better with a predefined waveform or you will need to examine lalsimulation output.
